I am a third year PhD student in statistics at Columbia University, advised by Liam Paninski. 

My research lies at the intersection of statistics, computational neuroscience. I focus on analyzing large-scale neural recordings and developing data-driven approaches to analyze and decode electrophysiological recordings. I am mostly interested in modeling real-world physical data using tools and techniques from signal processing, optimization, probabilistic modeling, machine learning, and dynamical systems. Recently, I have been expanding my research to understanding and quantifying uncertainty in machine learning models. I am also a researcher at the International Brain Laboratory. More broadly, I am interested in Brain-Computer interfaces, and the applications of Machine Learning methods to climate change.

Before my PhD, I graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in Applied Maths in 2017, before getting a masterâ€™s degree in Statistics at Stanford University, in 2019. During my Master, I was a research assistant under the supervision of Mykel Kochenderfer, where I built a RNN-based model for predicting Sleep Quality from EEG recordings, and did an internship at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at University College London where I developed an approach to learn an interpretable model of latent continuous dynamical systems.
